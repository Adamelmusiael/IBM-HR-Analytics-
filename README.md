# Employee Attrition Analysis

## Project OverviewüèÅ
This project aims to showcase my data analytics, data science, and machine learning skills by analyzing employee attrition using various tehchniques. The goal is to explore, analyze, visualize and predict factor influencing employee turnover.

## Obejctivesüìå
1. **Understand and explore dataset** using python (Jupyter Notebooks), SQL (PostgreSQL), Excel.
2. **Investigate key factors** influencing **attrition** through statistical and exploratory data analysis (EDA).
3. **Visualize** insights using Power BI for better interpretability.
4. Use machine learning models to determine **feature importance** in predicting attrition.

## Tools & Technologies Used‚öíÔ∏è
* Python (Pandas, Numpy, Matplotlib, Scikit-Learn, XGBoost...)- Data exploring, processing, visualization, and machine learning.
* PostgreSQL- Querying and analyzing the data.
* Excel- Reporting and documentation.
* PowerBI- Creating dashboards for visualization.
* Machine Learning Models- Feature importance extraction.

# 1. Data Exploration and Understanding 
## Key Steps:
Load and prepare data for analysis, dispaly basic statistics to get an overview, check for missing values and duplicates (none found), analyze categorical variable distributions, visualize data through various plots, export key findings to excel firle for documentation.
### Initial insights:
- Average employee age: **36 years**.
- Most employees work in the **Research & Development** department.
- Employees work an average of **7 years** in the company.
- **Attrition rate** is low, about **16%** (250 out of 1.5K employess left).
- High performance ratings and work-life balance are generally well maintained.

# 2. Investigating Factors Influencing Attrition
To gain deeper insights, SQL queries were used to answer key questions about employee demographics, job satisfaction, and salary.
## Demographics Analysis ‚úÖ
* Young employees **(25-34)** leave more often.
* Men have a **slightly higher attrition rate than women** (150 out of 240 employees who left were men).
* Single employees have a higher attrition rate, but the impact is minor.

## Job-Realted Factors ‚úÖ
* **Lower salaries** correlate with **higher attrition**.
* **Job satisfaction** affects attrition (employees with the lowest satisfaction had higher turnover).
* Employees with similar job levels who left were **paid less** than those who stayed.
* Performance rating is linked to attrition ‚Äì **employees with high ratings but low salary increases left.**
* Distance from home has a **slight impact** on attrition (farther employees tend to leave more).
* Poor work-life balance is linked to higher attrition.

## Company Related Factors ‚úÖ
* Employees with **fewer years** at the company are more **likely to leave.**
* Biggest attrition issues (in absolute numbers) are in Research & Development.
* **Job-hopping behavior is common** ‚Äì employees who worked in 5+ companies have a much higher attrition rate.

# 3. Data Visualization & Insightsüìà
A Power BI dashboard was created to visualize key findings.
## Dashboard Summary
