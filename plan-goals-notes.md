# Plan, Goals, Notes
In this project I would like to show my data analystics data science and machine learning skills at once. For that reason I will try to use multiple tools in order to show my wide range of skills.

# 1. Data Exploration and Understanding
I will start with exploring the dataset and trying to get more into it. To do any further analysis and modifications I need to understand it. My main tools for this purpose will be **python** (jupyter notebooks) , where I will be exploring the data. Secondly I will use Excelfor **documentation and reporting**. Using Excel in this project will is mainly intended to make it easier for other people who do not know python,sql etc. to view my work and to perform simple operations that do not require advanced technologies.    
Tasks:
* Load and prepare data for EDA in **jupyter notebook**
* Display basic statistics
* check for missing values
* analyze distribution of categorical varabiles
* create charts, plots etc. if needed
* export key statistics to excel file for documentation
